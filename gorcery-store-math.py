# Task 1: Grocery Store Math

cost_bread, cost_pb, cost_jelly = 5.99, 3.95, 3.95 
# Assign made up costs to grocery items 
total_cost = cost_bread + cost_pb + cost_jelly 
# add total prices together
print(total_cost) 
# Output: 13.89 

# Task 2: Bank Interest 

# Want to find total in savings + interest after one year 
savings = 15000   # Starting Savings amount
interest = (savings * 6) / 100  
# amount in savings * one year * interest rate 6, divide by 100 so its 6 percent
# Add interest amount to savings 
new_savings = savings + interest 
print(new_savings) 
# Output = 15900
